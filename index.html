          Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American
          lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th president of
          the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln
          led the Union through the American Civil War to defend the nation as a
          constitutional union and succeeded in abolishing slavery, bolstering
          the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.

          The following list is a time line of Lincolns Life :
        </h2>
        <p class="text bottom-text">
          Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was
          raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and
          became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and
          U.S. Congressman from Illinois.
        </p>
        <p class="text bottom-text">
          In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central
          Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which
          opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon
          became a leader of the new Republican Party.
        </p>
        <p class="text bottom-text">
          He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates
          against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860,
          sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South
          viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began
          seceding from the nation. During this time, the newly formed
          Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in
          the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency,
          the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South
          Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to
          suppress the rebellion and restore the union.
        </p>
        <p class="text bottom-text">
          Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to
          heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865,
          just five days after the war's end at Appomattox, he was attending a
          play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary, when
          he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.
          Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime
          leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish
          slavery. Lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls
          as the greatest president in American history.
